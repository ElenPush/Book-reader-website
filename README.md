# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create an immersive and interactive book reader website for the classic novel, showcasing the book's themes and atmosphere through design and animations.

## Process Highlights

- Chose the book based on its intriguing themes and genre, considering their impact on the website's design.
- Designed the layout using sketches, gathered resources, and built the HTML structure.
- Selected a monochromatic color scheme and fonts to create a vintage book feel.
- Implemented a reading progress bar, timeline animation, and interactive portraits using code from various sources.
- Created a grid layout for improved content organization and element positioning.
- Debugged and validated code, ensuring proper functionality and documentation.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Replaced the initial cover image with a clean one based on feedback.
- Removed the separate bottom section and horizontal navigation bar due to implementation difficulties, opting for a top progress bar and side menu instead.
- Resolved issues with map animation and portrait adaptivity by modifying the layout and triggering events.

## Using the Scraper

Install all dependencies, create the `auth.json` file, start the flask backend, run the react frontend and interact with the tool.

### auth.json

Fill in your [Bright Data Scraping Browser](https://brightdata.com/products/scraping-browser) credentials in a `backend/scraper/auth.json` file (see `auth_example.json`).

### Python Flask Backend

- `cd backend`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `playwright install`
- `python app.py` or `python3 app.py`

### Running the React Frontend

- `cd frontend`
- `npm i`
- `npm run start`

## Setting Up Automation

To automate the collection of prices from this software simply run the `scheduler/main.py` file at your desired increment while the python flask backend is running.

### Windows

I have created a simple `.bat` script called `run.bat` that you can schedule to execute using the Windows Task Scheduler that will automatically run the backend api and send the appropriate request to it.
