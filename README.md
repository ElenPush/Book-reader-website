**ElenPush/ElenPush** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
## Using the Scraper

Install all dependencies, create the `auth.json` file, start the flask backend, run the react frontend and interact with the tool.

### auth.json

Fill in your [Bright Data Scraping Browser](https://brightdata.com/products/scraping-browser) credentials in a `backend/scraper/auth.json` file (see `auth_example.json`).

### Python Flask Backend

- `cd backend`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `playwright install`
- `python app.py` or `python3 app.py`

### Running the React Frontend

- `cd frontend`
- `npm i`
- `npm run start`

## Setting Up Automation

To automate the collection of prices from this software simply run the `scheduler/main.py` file at your desired increment while the python flask backend is running.

### Windows

I have created a simple `.bat` script called `run.bat` that you can schedule to execute using the Windows Task Scheduler that will automatically run the backend api and send the appropriate request to it.
